What is your view of the ‘great British culture’ and how has EU membership eroded it?  Do answer with specifics if you can. Why do you think the EU hate us? They certainly don’t want us to leave but they’re not going to compromise their membership tenets to suit the U.K. - we already have a good deal. How would gifting £5billion to the US benefit the U.K. as much as membership to the EU has?  I doubt you’ll be able or willing to answer any of the above - just like Trump supporters, you’re not that bright and completely misinformed.  Twats like you shouldn’t have the vote."

This is The United States of America, it's our country and being a US Citizen is absolutely relevant – What the American People clearly want and need are more elected officials that will actually start putting the best interests of our own US CITIZENS first and foremost, and that includes appointing judges and others that will do the same.

He was killed instantly. The illegal immigrant was so intoxicated, he tried to urinate on the sheriff deputy’s car. While in jail, he got a Boca Raton lawyer who took us to court to dispute the charges. My family had to live through the awful experience of a trial and details of the accident.

I'll explane...  ~It forces USA metal to be used *(HUGE for American jobs and American steel sales generating billions) and it will keep automobile manufactures in the USA (worth billions).  ~Americans bought $71 billion more imports YEARLY from Mexico than vice versa. That's about to change in Americans favor.   ~At least 30% of the cars must be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour to keep American car manufactures in the USA (That increases to 40% in 2023:) Autos that don't meet these requirements will be subject to hefty tariffs.   ~Canada must open up its dairy market to U.S. farmers. It will eliminate its complex pricing scheme for Class 7 products. That includes milk protein concentrate, skim milk powder, and infant formula etc.   ~It opens the wine market in British Columbia to American wine. (Billions to America).  ~Mexican trucks must meet U.S. safety standards before crossing the border.   ~Provides more protection for patents and trademarks. Saving tons to American's who have been ripped off of their ideas & costs Americans billions and also helps reduce black market.   ~U.S. drug companies can sell products in Canada for 10 years before facing generic competition. Extending it by 2 years. (Billions generated)  ~Companies can no longer use Chapter 11 to resolve disputes with governments, they will now have to pay up instead. The only exceptions are U.S. oil companies.   ~We no longer fund Mexican abortion clinics. Exports drastically reduced, for one example sugar from Mexico cut nearly in half, creating more jobs and revenue, tourism industry hit hard, federal employees banned from traveling to certain main areas.  *Of course, Trump didn't really expect Mexico to just write the US a check as some ignorantly say as ""fact"" :)"
